I built a GenAI summarizer using Hugging Face Transformers, handled a PyTorch CVE by bypassing pipeline() and loading models securely via SafeTensors, and packaged it as a reusable mini-project on GitHub.

# GenAI Text Summarizer (Secure)

This project demonstrates a GenAI-based text summarizer built using
Hugging Face Transformers.

## Key Highlights
- Uses a pre-trained seq2seq model (distilBART)
- Explicit SafeTensors loading
- Avoids `torch.load` due to CVE-2025-32434
- Designed for enterprise-safe environments

## Use Cases
- Jira ticket summaries
- Incident postmortem summaries
- Program update condensation
- Release notes drafts

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.10
- PyTorch (CPU)
- Hugging Face Transformers
- SafeTensors
